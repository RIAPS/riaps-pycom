Files in this folder are for running various parts of riaps by the riaps APP developers.
These scripts are usually installed in a folder that is accessible via the PATH on the app developer's machine
(e.g. ~/.local/bin). The scripts assume that the environment variables RIAPSHOME and RIAPSAPPS are set up.   

These scripts are used only when mininet is used:
- riaps-dev.mn : launches the simple mininet configuration, uses sshd.py (which should be in the path)
- riaps-dev.ctrl: script to be run on the 'lead' node of mininet, launches the registry and the controller
- riaps-dev.node: script to be run on the 'slave' nodes of mininet, launches the deplo manager
- sshd.py: starts mininet with a 4 node network, each node running sshd.

The scripts listed below are used by all riaps installations (both on a development machine and the 
embedded targets):
- riaps_actor: the actor 
- riaps_ctrl: the controller
- riaps_ctrl_host: provides IP address(es) of the RIAPS Control host
- riaps_depll: the deployment language processor
- riaps_deplo: the deployment manager
- riaps_device: the device actor
- riaps_disco: the discovery service
- riaps_fab: the communication tool for multiple nodes
- riaps_gen: the riaps file generator based on model files
- riaps_gen_cert: the security key generator
- riaps_gviz: the graphic visualization processor
- riaps_lang: the modeling language processor
- riaps_log_config_test: test app for log configuration file
- riaps_logger: the framework log server
