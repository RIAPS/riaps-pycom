# Fabric File for Handling Multiple RIAPS Nodes Setup
The **riaps_fab** script provides tools for configuring and controlling multiple RIAPS nodes.  This can be used with large or small clusters (even a single one) of RIAPS nodes.  For information on using this tool, see https://github.com/RIAPS/riaps-pycom/tree/develop-U22/src/riaps/rfab.
