# Fabric File for Handling Multiple BBB Setup
The fabfile.py provides tools for configuring and controlling multiple BBBs.  This can be used with large or small clusters (even a single one) of BBBs.  This section explains the tools available and how to use them.  The **fabfile.py** can be customized to your system (and should be).  Use this tool as guidance for ideas of functions that could be used to work with multiple host nodes.	
- To utilize the fabric tool, type the following with the command name desired.  If you do not know the command name, just type something and help information will be provided
```
	$ fab <command_name>
```

- To setup a list of host nodes that are to be controlled by the fab command, edit the **fabfile.py** and update the **env.hosts** information
```
	# ---- START OF EDIT HERE ----
	# List of bbb hosts
	# BBBs can be addressed by their IP address or the hostname.local (found at the command prompt on the BBB)
	env.hosts = ['192.168.0.101', 'bbb-ff98.local']
	# ----  END OF EDIT HERE  ----
```

## For host node maintenance
- To check that all host nodes are communicating, use the **hello_hosts** command
```
	$ fab hello_hosts
```
- To update host nodes to the latest RIAPS platform release, use the **update_riaps** command
```
	$ fab update_riaps
```

## To control RIAPS operation (manual control)
- RIAPS controller can be launched on a control host sytem using
```
	$ fab riaps
```
- Start deployment on all host nodes using
```
	$ fab deplo
```

## To control RIAPS services (for more automation)
- Start the deployment on the host nodes when the system is booted up with **startDeplo**.  This will also start the discovery process. 
- Turn the deployment service off on the host nodes by using **stopDeplo**.  This will also stop and disable the discovery service.
- When using the RIAPS services, the application logs are stored in the system logs with a tag for the service.  To pull this information into your own file, use the **createDeployLogs** command.  These logs are continuous.  So if you want only the logs from the current testing set, first **clear_journal_log**.
- To control activity on RIAPS host nodes use either **stop**, **halt**, or **reboot**.  The **halt** should be done prior to powering down the hosts.

## Time synchronization functions 
- **timeStamp** will compare the clocks on the hosts
- **checkPTP** checks to see if ptp is running on the control host

## System utilities available	
- Transfer files between the control host and the host nodes use the following command.  Be sure to edit the **fabfile.py** to find the right locations of where to get and place the files.  If transferring to a system location, use_sudo=True.
	**fileTransferFrom** will transfer files from host nodes to the control host
	**fileTransferTo** will transfer files to the host nodes from the control host 
- Configure routing in a cluster that has a gateway to the internet using *config_routing*.  Be sure to edit the **fabfile.py** to update the gateway address.


# Utilities for Mininet Operations
This is for RIAPS developers - NOT for APP developers.

The scripts are as follows:
- riaps.mn: launches a simple mininet configuration, uses sshd.py. RIAPS environment variables must be set.  
- riaps-mn.ctrl: script to be run on the 'lead' node of mininet, launches the registry and the controller
- riaps-mn-dns.ctrl: similar to the riaps-mn.ctrl, but it also launches a small dns server so that
  symbolic names can be used to access the mininet nodes. NOT RECOMMENDED.
- riaps-mn.node : script to be run on the 'slave' nodes of mininet, launches the deplo manager
- pytinydns.py, pytinydns.host, pytinydns.conf: the script for the small dns server (used by riaps-mn-dns.ctrl),
  and its configuration files.
- sshd.py: starts mininet with a 4 node network, each node running sshd. Used for mininet-based testing.
